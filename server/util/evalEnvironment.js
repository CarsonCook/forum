** The Environment object is used to provide a safe environment in which scripts can be run.
** Note that while the environment is "safe", the changes made to the database will be permanent.
** Thus, bad code can be injected while using this that can cause data loss if this is not used sparingly.
** Use of this object is not permitted while the system is in production, nor the evaluation of
** user-provided scripts.
