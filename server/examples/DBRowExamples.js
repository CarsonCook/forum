**
** Shows how to use the getRow() method of DBRow. The getRow() method relies on an id to
** return a row immediately. All other query parameters add using addQuery() before calling getRow()
** are ignored. After we call getRow(), the row object then contains the object we got back from the
** database. If we were successful, there will be exactly one row.
**
** NOTE: if the get call does not get a row back because the id doesn't match anything on the table,
** the promise is NOT rejected. It is your job to make sure that the row is there before you start trying
** to do work with it.

/* queryARowExample()
**
** Shows how to use the query() method of DBRow. In order to perform a query, we can add query
** parameters using the addQuery() method. Once we are ready, we call query() and the row variable will
** contain the result of the query (undefined if the query failed to match anything or an array of rows
** if the query succeeds).
**
** NOTE: if you submit a really vague query (like I did here) in a production environment, you get get hundreds
** if not thousands of rows back, which will cause more strain on the system than if you make your query more
** specific in the first place! Do everyone a favor and be as specific as you can when querying.

/* updateARow()
**
** Shows how to use the update() method of DBRow. This method will be useful when something is edited or a vote is changed.
** To update a row we first have to get the row we want to update. After we query that row, we can then make modifications
** to it using the setValue() method. Once we've changed what we want to change, we simply call update().
**
** NOTE: never update ids. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Changing the id of a post causes a lot of problems because
** everything that refers to that post does so using its id (which could cause thousands of reference problems). Like I said,
** don't do it.

/* deleteARowExample()
**
** Shows how to use the delete() method of DBRow. This method would often be used in conjunction
** with the query() method because most of the time you won't know the id of the row to be deleted right off the bat.
** Once you have the row or the id of the row, you can then call delete to permanently destroy the row.
**
** NOTE: This example does not show the work that would need to be done to delete everything referring to the row
** deleted in this example. This would be especially important if a post, comment or user is deleted for some reason.

/* Using wildcards

** filter for extremely specific terms within larger blocks of text. These queries CANNOT be
** combined with other queries.
**
** For full documentation of all the things wildcards can do google SQL wildcards.
